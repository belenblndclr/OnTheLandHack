# On The Land Hack
Circumventing limitations with all the creativity of the community
Territory, internet and hacks, what an odd combination. Or at least it used to be. With the alarming increased of “solutions” proposed by both politic and civic organization to solve the “technology gaps” in territory, that combination tend to become more and more common. But it may should not be. Is every city should create Fab Labs or Coworking spaces ? Or are those  global conceptual solutions put on a local scale shouldn't be redesign for every specific situation.

	We used to walk our all life without needing to dematerialized our environment. Practicing city and road easily, with transportation needing effort, resources and time. Our journey was constantly disturb by the environment around us. Beautiful landscape or huge traffic could drasticly influence our emotional representation of space. Feeling a space enough to be able to categorized has either best or worst place on earth. Our map where drawn to fit our representation of space, plane and limited. But the coast of a country is infinite, we will never be able to have a fixed distances between two points due to the environment itself. Just as our planisphere is a false representation of our planet because a sphere can never be translate into a rectangle. The representation we made of our dimensions is scientific but mostly emotionally connect to our self, therefore unique and infinite for each of its practicing.

	Then came the network of networks. Internet change society more quickly than every other technological innovation ever did. In 15 years, our use of this network entirely change our representation of our dimensions, all 4. Our representation of distance, plane and space have been change before, but for the first time, it's time perception itself that has evolved, transforming it from a fixed variable to a relative one. 
	We are now able to join simultaneously half the human population by just a clicking threw uniform resource locator. Digital public space are more and more opens to active intervention from individual, expanding from all sides and directions, reenforcing individual autonomy and tumbling everything toward communal and accessible.
	This network make knowledge easily available to anyone with the desire to learn, even the knowledge of the network itself. By putting intelligence not in it's heart but on the terminal of the network, Internet creator made possible a mutually beneficial relationship between users and makers. And Internet keeps on evolving, being change by it's users practices itself.

	This practices where first considered  deviant and made by a minority among user, but sociology prove that masses have always been critical about technology around them. By narrowing  the gaps between make and use, even allowing user to easily became makers, Internet was able to spread horizontal innovation, or hacking, and while making it legal and admitted.
	Although hacking is often reduce has online actions, its can be more defined as any innovation made on an existing system, and it should not be restricted to digital world. Our day-life need innovation and what more important system that our country, city and territory. So lets creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations by intellectually challenging our material self.

## Why Git
Git is distributed version control. It has two big differences with traditional version control systems. The first is that it lives up to the philosophical promise of open-source. Everybody who works on a project has access to all of the source code all of the time.
Git is a formidable plateform were everyone can make improvement. One using Git can make any important change at all, creating a new file, modifying an existing one, merging two files... 

GitHub create a common grammar, therefore everything and everyone is equal. 

## Research Presentation
This project is the result of a 3 months research process. 

# “Bien vacant”, a third space [Extract]

'Bien vacant' (vacant goods), is a term I personally first encounter in an interview of Algerian journalist and author Kamel Daoud. When I first search it, I encounter the legal side of this expression and the commonly used synonym for it: « Bien sans maître » (Masterless Goods), used legally to characterized a real estate left without succession. Daoud used it not to describe a property but to characterized the french language when used by native Algerian. On the eve of the newly independent state of Algeria, french were consider as a spoils the defeated, but 50 years later, the government and administration now speak Arabic, and french as become something else. It became « a ghost house, however solidly built, where one can dream for an other life » (« Une maison de fantômes, pourtant solidement construite, où l’on peut rêver d’une autre vie » Kamel Daoud, Meursault contre-enquête). Internet and the network help make materiality of the good irrelevant. The fact that it can be touch threw the human hand does no longer matter. This good became a possibility, a creative gateway to a place never explore before. That idea of 'bien vacant', is odly similar to the one of hack develop thought this thesis. 

At this point, I am going to draw the premise of an utopia. Internet prove that disorganization and chaos can create an autonomous and morally neutral entity. This space is lawless and yet, the brain ruling it, the users, are making sure of a continual self-regulation. Open source initiative prove that ethics and feasible philosophy, politics and economics system are possible. And users from all around the world are blurring the distinction between immaterial and material.

This space, this print into the territory, cannot be cold an EPN, or a coworking space, or a Fablab, it's not even an hacker space. The context matter more than any classification or denomination.  I've used my field research to try to determine this context, spaciously and semantic. The snapshot I've try to surround is small and in many way complete and incomplete. It's complete because it's represent the context of the persons drawing this map at this moment, poring their filling and implication into it, therefore who can decide that their filling matter less than other : don't create average, create denser. Incomplete because the form itself of the practice was restraining capacity and possibility. Not all are good with pen, and paper doesn't allow to record the progression, only the final result if left, not like with computer that can create a register of points in a space-time dimension. In this state of mind, Internet isn't only the starting point, but the main characteristics itself of this space. It's both material and immaterial, tangible and abstract and have the sames that rules of the network-of-network: open, shared and mutable.

* <b>Open</b> To spirit and body. <br>
Every one with the drive of hacking their everyday life can enter this space and live in it. From geek to farmer, student, homeless, elder or artist, this chaotic place don't need nor recognize label. It shouldn't have opening hours neither.

* <b>Shared</b> Between individual, groups and territory. <br>
This place can be hosting school, gym classes or computer club. Half home half other, this a mix between the comfort of feeling and the passion of making. Their is no chief, permanent team or mediator. Every user is chief, member of the team or mediator by being part of this place.

* <b>Mutable</b> Hack without border. <br>
This place is a lawless enclave, where liberty, as an ideology, prevail. Try, guess, fail, success, by living and expanding. Do not ask for permission nor ask for forgiveness, ask for help, because their is no bad idea, only underrating ones. 

There is no restriction, no opening hour, no chief, no rules nor leader. This place is a « no-space» where « can't » doesn't have a seat. Internet provide access to infinity of possibility and this what this place should be about, countless hours of make, share and learn.

But more importantly, I expect that all the guidance I just made will be break, ignore, and rethink. Firstly because imposing a will on a space like this one is, by definition his exact opposite. But mainly because I am not titled of dictating any guidance, I'm merely someone dreaming to it. This is a meritocracy, involve yourself and you will receive accordingly, not from an individual, or a city hall, or a general assembly, but from yourself.
