## “Bien vacant”, a third space [Extract]

'Bien vacant' (vacant goods), is a term I personally first encounter in an interview of Algerian journalist and author Kamel Daoud. When I first search it, I encounter the legal side of this expression and the commonly used synonym for it: « Bien sans maître » (Masterless Goods), used legally to characterized a real estate left without succession. Daoud used it not to describe a property but to characterized the french language when used by native Algerian. On the eve of the newly independent state of Algeria, french were consider as a spoils the defeated, but 50 years later, the government and administration now speak Arabic, and french as become something else. It became « a ghost house, however solidly built, where one can dream for an other life » (« Une maison de fantômes, pourtant solidement construite, où l’on peut rêver d’une autre vie » Kamel Daoud, Meursault contre-enquête). Internet and the network help make materiality of the good irrelevant. The fact that it can be touch threw the human hand does no longer matter. This good became a possibility, a creative gateway to a place never explore before. That idea of 'bien vacant', is odly similar to the one of hack develop thought this thesis. 

At this point, I am going to draw the premise of an utopia. Internet prove that disorganization and chaos can create an autonomous and morally neutral entity. This space is lawless and yet, the brain ruling it, the users, are making sure of a continual self-regulation. Open source initiative prove that ethics and feasible philosophy, politics and economics system are possible. And users from all around the world are blurring the distinction between immaterial and material.

This space, this print into the territory, cannot be cold an EPN, or a coworking space, or a Fablab, it's not even an hacker space. The context matter more than any classification or denomination.  I've used my field research to try to determine this context, spaciously and semantic. The snapshot I've try to surround is small and in many way complete and incomplete. It's complete because it's represent the context of the persons drawing this map at this moment, poring their filling and implication into it, therefore who can decide that their filling matter less than other : don't create average, create denser. Incomplete because the form itself of the practice was restraining capacity and possibility. Not all are good with pen, and paper doesn't allow to record the progression, only the final result if left, not like with computer that can create a register of points in a space-time dimension. In this state of mind, Internet isn't only the starting point, but the main characteristics itself of this space. It's both material and immaterial, tangible and abstract and have the sames that rules of the network-of-network: open, shared and mutable.

* <b>Open</b> To spirit and body. <br>
Every one with the drive of hacking their everyday life can enter this space and live in it. From geek to farmer, student, homeless, elder or artist, this chaotic place don't need nor recognize label. It shouldn't have opening hours neither.

* <b>Shared</b> Between individual, groups and territory. <br>
This place can be hosting school, gym classes or computer club. Half home half other, this a mix between the comfort of feeling and the passion of making. Their is no chief, permanent team or mediator. Every user is chief, member of the team or mediator by being part of this place.

* <b>Mutable</b> Hack without border. <br>
This place is a lawless enclave, where liberty, as an ideology, prevail. Try, guess, fail, success, by living and expanding. Do not ask for permission nor ask for forgiveness, ask for help, because their is no bad idea, only underrating ones. 

There is no restriction, no opening hour, no chief, no rules nor leader. This place is a « no-space» where « can't » doesn't have a seat. Internet provide access to infinity of possibility and this what this place should be about, countless hours of make, share and learn.

But more importantly, I expect that all the guidance I just made will be break, ignore, and rethink. Firstly because imposing a will on a space like this one is, by definition his exact opposite. But mainly because I am not titled of dictating any guidance, I'm merely someone dreaming to it. This is a meritocracy, involve yourself and you will receive accordingly, not from an individual, or a city hall, or a general assembly, but from yourself.
