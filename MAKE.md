#Methodology
The participants are asked to sit down with me for about 10 minutes. Any one with the desire to participate were welcome, the only selection criteria was to lived or work in Chambéry. The interview often last longer, about 15 minutes for a single participant. I start by explaining the purpose of the drawing, explaining the context, and then let the participant take over the exercise.
The degree of seize of the exercise depend of the participant, some seem comfortable with the exercise, some need a lot of guidance, some need an actual map to complete the exercise.
Normally, the interviews are individual but exception are made if ask or in special case (for instance a younger audience).

##Methodology adjustment
Between the first and the second session a high quality microphone has been add to the experience.
Moreover, the time aloud to draw the map has been cut shorter to not let participant drift.

This maps are merely the starting point my reflexion. They have two mains purposes. 

* The first one is to find out how citizens perceive their environment and their city. My first goal was to find a place, an area in the city were the “Bien Vacant” could step in, trying to find a place where this place could guess and try. Expect that my panel of participants was a bit short, therefor I might have missed an area. However, I will recommend any future relationship with the place where I was gathering the information, the MJC, because their openhanded  was great. 
* The second purposes was to observe the hack they could come up during the process. By offering them a support and a tool, I've observe (with my eyes and vocally) how they took on the challenge and if they were volunteer in the exercise. Surprisingly, they were only 1 un-volunteer participant (statistically, that's 8% of the panel). What's the more surprising is how they took the exercise: with a lot of attention, and a lot of reflexion, thinking and rethinking their path and journey, try to hack map distortion situation with “narrative” twist.
